        In late 2020, her health deteriorated and we lost touch.
      </div>
      <div>
        I really felt sad and anxious and I prayed that she is fine.
      </div>
      <div>
        Time passed and I hoped that we would talk again.
      </div>
      <div>
        One day, she sent me a message and she told me about what happened in her life.
      </div>
      <div>
        She was still sick, but I was so happy to talk again after a long time.
      </div>
      <div>
        Fortunately, she got better and we met.
